# Agent Working Rules

## Commit Discipline
- Keep git history clean and working.
- Commit step by step, one logical change at a time.
- Each commit must be runnable and pass relevant tests.
- Do not mix refactors with behavior changes in one commit.
- Prefer small commits with clear diffs and concise lowercase messages.

## Minimal Process
1. Make one scoped change.
2. Run the relevant tests/checks.
3. Commit immediately.
4. Repeat.
